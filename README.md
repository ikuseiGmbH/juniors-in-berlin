# Let's support Juniors

This repository is a starting point to collect information about companies worldwide **supporting junior developers**.  

**Juniors** are developers that are at the beginning of their career. Maybe they are working students studying computer science or teached themselfes at home. Maybe they joined a bootcamp or Rails Girls Summer of Code. Though they might have some knowledge they are incredibly eager to explore more and learn best practice from their future colleagues.  

### Situation  

Many companies state that they have no time, money and capacity for juniors. But if all companies continue with that mindset there won't be any seniors in the future. Let's help the juniors grow!  

We want to collect offers for **intern and junior positions** to give beginners an idea where they could apply. Moreover, we want to discuss guidelines for **how to teach** juniors in your company.  

### About us

Bodo is a developer at bitcrowd and is currently preparing their Junior Developer Curriculum.  
Malwine works as a junior at DaWanda. Both want to encourage companies to hire and support juniors.  
The idea for the repo resulted from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/bitboxer/status/558921160562597890) from Bodo:
> Does someone have a list of companies in Berlin offering internships or hire junior developers? Want to talk how you guide and teach them.
